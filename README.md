# Compiler-Construction

	Brendan Thompson
	Transylvania University	Compiler Construction Fall 2017 with Dr. Moorman

Implementation of a "Transy" language compiler. Repository Created for downloading, compiling, and running the code on a lab computer remotely from my personal machine. (Still have to get onto campus wifi though)

Check out the DevLog in each version of the compiler to see the status of construction reported daily
